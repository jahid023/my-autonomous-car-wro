Our project includes several custom-designed 3D-printed parts to ensure a stable and functional structure for the autonomous vehicle. These parts were modeled using [mention software used, e.g., Fusion 360, TinkerCAD, or SolidWorks] and printed with PLA filament.

ðŸ§© 3D-printed components:
Camera holder â€“ to securely position the Pi Camera at a fixed forward angle

Ultrasonic sensor mounts â€“ to accurately orient the sensors at the front, left, and right angles

Battery holder â€“ to keep the power supply stable during motion

Electronics tray / Base plate adapter â€“ for organizing components on the chassis

All 3D models are included in the /models/ folder in .STL format, ready for printing.

These custom parts improved the stability, cable management, and sensor accuracy, contributing to smoother obstacle detection and track following.
